## 🔍 **What’s Included**

- **Dataset Preparation:** Loading and preprocessing image data for training and evaluation.
- **Neural Network Architecture:** Implementing a custom feedforward neural network using PyTorch’s nn.Module.
- **Training Loop:** Writing a training loop using PyTorch’s optimiser and loss modules.
- **Evaluation:** Measuring performance on a test dataset using metrics such as accuracy or loss.
- **Visualisation:** Displaying training loss curves and sample predictions for analysis.
- **Report:** Discussion of architecture, training results, and any challenges encountered.

## 🧰 **Files & Functions**

- **SimpleNet:** Defines the architecture of the neural network *(**e.g.** fully connected layers, activation functions).*
- `train_model(...)`: Handles model training, loss calculation, and optimisation steps.
- `evaluate_model(...)`: Tests the trained model and generates evaluation metrics.
- `plot_results(...)`: Plots training metrics and visual output samples.
