        "In this part of the assignment you need to write a report about an application of a computer vision algorithm or technique. This can either be an application that you are aware of and possibly even use, such as a phone app, or it could be speculation -- an application that you think would benefit from using computer vision.\n",

        "**b.** Increasing the resolution of an image.\n",

        "**d.** Segmenting images into constituents parts.\n",

        "**e.** Estimating the depth of an object from one or more images.\n",

        "Now think about various ways your chosen technique could be used. Here is a list of possible applications you could consider, but you are not restricted to this list, and there will be credit given for sensible invention outside this list (but no penalty if you don't want to be \"inventive\"): image editing systems in your phone; enhancement of images from old film; obstacle detection and avoidance for a domestic robot; facial recognition for phone security; cancer detection; person tracking and re-identification in security cameras; sport decision review systems; road-sign detection and interpretation for self-driving cars.\n",

        "**2.** Briefly describe a solution based on image processing, computer vision and/or machine learning.\n",

        "**3.** Discuss the advantages and the limitations of this method in various application scenarios.\n",
